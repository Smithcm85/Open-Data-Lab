\subsection{Income}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cash: The DSI allocated \$6,000 for computation and storage from AWS from the period of April 1, 2018 - March 31, 2019. These funds are drawn from PTAO 147242.102.LC00112.30002.
\item Cash: The Healthy Markets research project used ODL services for computation and storage on AWS. The ODL is authorized to transfer cost in proportion to the Healthy Markets PTAO 147412.107.DR03397.30002.
\item Personnel: The DSI allocated 50\% of a staff Data Scientist's time to the ODL project (1/2 FTE). The Clark lab contributed XXX hours of research assistant time.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Outlays}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cash: During 2018 the ODL spent \$897 on AWS.
\item Personnel: The ODL used the 1/2 FTE from the staff Data Scientist as well as a small ammount of time in meetings from various collaborators. AWS code development was contributed by Tim Clark's lab research assistant.
\end{itemize}

\section{Balance Sheet} % assets and liabilities
At this time the Open Data Lab does not have any physical assets. There are digital assets including the materials stored on the github repository.

At this time the Open Data lab does not have any physical liabilities. There are liabilities in the form of commitments to ongoing research and education efforts in and around the DSI. Any decrease in support of personnel or funding will undermine the Open Data Lab's ability to cover those liabilities.

Note further R\& D efforts are not included and require additional personnel. Also moving operations from beta to production requires additional FTE assignment and personnel would have to be hired to meet that need.
