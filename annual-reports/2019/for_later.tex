\section{Balance Sheet} % assets and liabilities
At this time the Open Data Lab does not have any physical assets. There are digital assets including the materials stored on the github repository.

At this time the Open Data lab does not have any physical liabilities. There are liabilities in the form of commitments to ongoing research and education efforts in and around the DSI. Any decrease in support of personnel or funding will undermine the Open Data Lab's ability to cover those liabilities.

Note further R\&D efforts are not included and require additional personnel. Also moving operations from beta to production requires additional FTE assignment and personnel would have to be hired to meet that need.
